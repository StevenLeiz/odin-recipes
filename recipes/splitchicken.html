            <h2>Description</h2> 
            <p>We all have had dry chicken before, but that will no longer be an issue after you try this simple baked chicken recipe. This herb-infused chicken dish can go with anything you choose to make it with. It's also a great dish for those looking for any easy recipe for meal-prep.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
                <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; sprinkle with salt, black pepper, rosemary, and basil. Arrange chicken in a large baking dish.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast meat should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
